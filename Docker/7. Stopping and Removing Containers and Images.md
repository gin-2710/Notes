### Stopping a container
A container that is currently running can be stopped using the command: `docker stop (optional parameters) <container_id>`. This command gracefully stops the containers, i.e., the executing program is completed before the container is stopped. This can take up to 10s for greedy containers. To force stop a running container, the optional parameter `-t 0` is used.
Example Usage:
`docker stop f5rd` -> graceful stop
`docker stop -t 0 hgdr` -> force stop

Note: Forcibly stopping a container may cause data loss.

### Removing containers
Docker does not automatically remove containers that are in the idle state. Since these idle containers are retained, it takes up a lot of space. In order to avoid this, idle containers can be removed from docker. To do this, the command below is used:
`docker rm <container_id>`

Note: 
- Only containers that are not currently running can be removed. If a container is in the running state, stop the container using `docker stop` command and then remove it.
- If the container has to be removed in one go, use `-f` parameter before the container id. This may cause data loss.

### Removing images
Removing a docker container does not remove the pulled/built docker image. To remove the image, command - `docker rmi <image_name>` is used.
If the docker image is currently running in a container, the optional parameter `-f` can be used.
