Docker CLI can be used to create/start and check the current status of a docker container.
### Creating a docker container the long way:
1. `docker container create <image_name>(:<insert_tag, optional>)`
	- This command is used to create a docker container from the given docker image.
	- When the command is executed, docker first looks for the image locally to pull. If not found, it will search and pull the image from a remote image repo in DockerHub by default.
	- *Note: When a container is created, it does not mean that the container is running.*
	- Example Usage:
			`docker create hello_world:latest` 

2. `docker ps (--all)`	
	- This command shows the currently running containers with their current status and container id among other details.
	- the `--all` flag shows all the containers even if they are just created or stopped.
	- Example Usage:
		`docker ps`

3. `docker start <container_id>`
	- This command is used to start a container that was recently created or stopped.
	- You can pass the first few letters of the container id if they are unique. In the worst case scenario, pass the entire container id.
	- *Note: By default, logs are not attached to the terminal. If you want to attach it in one go with this command, use the flag `--attach`.*
	- Example Usage:
		`docker start ab3`

4. `docker logs <container_id>`
	- Prints logs for a particular container
	- Example Usage:
		`docker logs ab3`

5. `docker attach <container_id>`
	- Attach the passed container's logs to the terminal
	- - Example Usage:
		`docker attach ab3`

### \[PREFFERED] Creating a docker container using the short way:
Use command `docker run <image_name>(:<insert_tag, optional>)`.
This command creates, starts and attaches logs to the terminal.

Note: Unlike `docker start` command, when `docker run` is executed, the container id is not displayed as an output on the terminal screen. To get the container id when `docker run` is executed, use `docker ps` command.
