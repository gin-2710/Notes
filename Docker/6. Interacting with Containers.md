After the docker container has started running, if we want to interact with the containers terminal, we should start the container's terminal within our terminal.
To do this, use the `docker exec` command.
**Additional parameters are:**
--interative -> opening an interactive terminal session
--tty -> ensure that communication between our terminal session and docker terminal session is smooth
-it -> shorthand combining --interactive and --tty

**Example usage:**
`docker exec -it <container_id> <statement to run to start terminal>`
