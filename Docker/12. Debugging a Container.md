Debugging a container is needed when the container does not start or runs too slowly. Some commands that help in debugging are:
1. `docker stats` 
	- Shows the containers the cpu/memory usage and limits.
	- Good for getting a overview into resources utilized by the container
2. `docker top <container_id>`
	- Shows the running stats at a process level inside a container
	- It allows you to get a current stats without having to run `docker exec`
3. `docker inspect`
	- It gives detailed information about the container
	- It returns the data in JSON format by default
	- Example - mounts, retries, volumes, etc.
