In Mac and Windows, docker images are stored in a directory inside a virtual machine. If this directory runs out of space, creating docker images would lead to an error.

To solve this issue, the following can be done:
1. Increase the CPU and Ram usage of the directory that stores the images -> use .wslconfig file
2. Remove unused images from the directory using:
	1. `docker rmi <image_id1/name1> <image_id2/name2>`
	2. `docker system prune`
