Whatever file/data is saved in the docker container is lost when the container is stopped/removed. In order to preserve the data that was created in the docker container when it was active, we use volume mounting where a file/directory in the host system is mounted to a directory/file in the docker container.

There are three cases in volume mounting:
1. Host and container contains the file/directory: classic case, the file/directory is mounted
2. Host contains file but container does not: the file is created in the container (EX: node modules)
3. Host and container do not contain file: docker creates the file as a directory in the container and displays a warning that the passed file_name is a directory.

Syntax: `docker run -v <host_path>:<container_path>`
