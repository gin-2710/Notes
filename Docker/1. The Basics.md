- **Namespace**:
	- Feature of linux kernel where one set of processes get access to one set of resources while another set of processes get access to another set of resources. Namespace create partitions.
	- It gives an isolated view of resources fore processes inside a container.

- **Control groups** - it limits and accounts for isolation of resources. It restricts the maximum cpu allocation. ![[Pasted image 20250504212453.png]]
