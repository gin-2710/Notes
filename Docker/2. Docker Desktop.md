Previous to the launch of Docker Desktop, Docker Machine was released by Docker.

The Docker Machine used Virtual box which needed additional virtual management by the user.
This was infeasible since users needed to learn virtual box management just to use docker (higher learning curve).
Additionally, Docker Machine also has performance issues such as:
1. Slow disk process when volume mount was involved
2. Slow network performance while using exposed ports

**Docker and OS:**
Docker runs natively on Linux and higher versions of the Windows OS. For MacOS, Docker Client creates a small virtual machine that runs a small Linux based VM.
