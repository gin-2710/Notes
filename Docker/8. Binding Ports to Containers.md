Port Binding - Mapping a port on the host machine with an exposed port in the docker container.
This allows external traffic to reach the container through the host. In Docker, port binding and port forwarding are the same.

Syntax:
`docker run -d -p <port_on_host>:<exposed_container_port>  <image_name>`

Example Usage:
`docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx`

Trick to remember the ports:
HCC - host : container
